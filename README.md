A seemigly stupid FlaskApp that lets You "chat" with The Kenya Constitution 2010.
I used Flask for the UI, SocketIO and PyMuPDF libraries to seemigly "chat" with The Kenya Constitution 2010 PDF document.
You can use this method to "chat" with any other document, You just have to install a few libraries to make it a reality.
Since most of us have Android phones, I shall use the Kivy library to turn this Python App to an Android App.
